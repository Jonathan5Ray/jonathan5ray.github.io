<h2> In-Class Assignment </h2>
  <p> My idea of a good website is something that is aesthetically pleasing while also being user friendly. The interface is not overly crowded, meaning that the spacing of the website isn’t so condensed that users become flustered with too much material.  My preferable style of a website is a double banner lining the top of the page, with at least one side panel that allows users to scroll for information that is important but not necessary to the sites function.  I like pictures that add to the general feel of the site, but not too may that it becomes too cramped or images that bear no relation to the material presented. It also depends on what the website’s intention is, whether that be a social media site, a shopping site, or maybe even a news website. The websites intention heavily dictates its aesthetic as the intended audience plays a major part in how a site is constructed to be navigated.</p> 
	<p2> With my website, my design is something I hope is clean and easy-to-use. I want to tighten the text along the heading and have the website be quirky and weird. The color scheme is something I wish to be revolving from link to link, but hopes that the colors on each page compliment each other. I’d rather not have a complex aesthetic, as it is not what I appreciate in a website and I don’t wish to reflect something I don’t even appreciate. I think the “wow” of my website will be from the images I decide to upload and post that are of me. I may struggle with getting them in, as it has proven to be a pain in the ass but hopefully the website is exactly what I want it to be. </p2>
