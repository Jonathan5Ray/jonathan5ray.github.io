<h3> Reflection </h3>
  <p ALIGN=CENTER> My approach to this website was one of a “newbie,” not having any skills in computer science or coding of any sort. Through videos and learning first-hand from repetition of failure and success by just fiddling around with the code itself, I think I have grown comfortable with both Github and HTML. Although I may not be an expert I am growing with my skills and hope they will develop over time. My biggest difficulty has been getting an image to appear correctly after inserting the code into my layout. I have watched multiple Linda videos, as well as YouTube “how-to’” videos, but to no avail. I have used a link I got from Facebook that has successfully worked but I cannot get my profile image to not be shown. Hopefully this is something I can achieve but after a significant amount of time spent on this already, I will seek some assistance in office hours
 I find that CSS is interesting in terms of what you can do with it, but I am having difficulty getting my CSS to be different from link to link, as it is the same across all webpages. I have created CSS files in each individual folder but they won’t apply and it continues to keep reading the CSS sheet that is in my original repository. My next objective I plan on knocking out in my eventual quest of CSS and HTML is to have a drop-down menu along the top banner. My difficulty with this is just trouble with getting the tags all the way down and knowing their exact placement. Time will tell though, as my difficulties will not last forever. 
	Also, to set goals for myself in the class I also hope that I will successfully learn how professional coders approach basic HTML. Meaning, I would like to learn the basic methods that real-life coders have developed that allow them to master the basics steps or introductory levels of HTML that I am still stuck on. I’d also like to learn how coders approach a website before they even begin. I understand the five web design concepts—alignment, contrast, repetition, contrast, proximity— and I would like to see how professionals approach a task, what concepts they value more versus what they don’t, etc. Personally, I believe that contrast is the biggest key in an aesthetically pleasing website. Having contrast that operates as a cohesive agent rather than an inhibiting one is something I hope I can incorporate into my design. Considering the functionality of my website is to present my own content rather than selling or advertising something, then I don’t really need all the complexity that other websites require. With this, I am trying to approach the website with the thought in mind that I’d rather have it be more attractive than complex.
	For the Craigslist ad, I decided to completely re-do my assignment as my original “Kayak for Sale” wasn’t as interesting as I first thought, rather going with the “LOKING FOR A ROOMATE” ad instead. This time, I took the role of a man and his brother who are looking for a third roommate—after they had kicked out their last roommate (and collected his security deposit) for violating the “the food labeling system [they] provide for maximum efficiency in the kitchen.” It was funny to an extent, as I parodied the typical leasing ads that are littered all over Craigslist. I think the revised version is written well and stands more pronounced on the page compared to the previous version. 
	 I also revised my biography as I felt it was written poorly, adding in some of my favorite hobbies, sports teams, as well as some of my favorite artist’s, such as Big L, Nas, and others. Just slight revisions that add to the entire feel of the site. Hopefully I can incorporate a few images on this page and add to the sense of who I am as an individual.
	 Personally, I really like the aesthetic of my website. The Allen font I decided to use for the headers is attractive and is complemented well by the gold background. The red font color used for the paragraphs also sits well along the gold background. To add to the overall feel, I think that the direction I should head next is to add images (which stated before I have had difficulty with.) I have a few I have already selected to be on my homepage, such as a picture of me, one of the Cathedral, one of me as a child, and another one at graduation. They’ll give you a sense of me as a person, as well as where I come from. I have thought about changing the color schemes, maybe to black and gold rather than the gold and red—a nod to the city of Pittsburgh—but I’d rather have the website be bright and colorful rather than depressing and dark. Overall, the direction for my website is something clean and attractive. Not a sore on the eyes, but also not too bland. That obviously isn’t the overall effect of my site in its current state, as it is only a static work in progress, but eventually.
