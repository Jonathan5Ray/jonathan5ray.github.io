<h2> Craigslist Ad </h2>
	<p> Hello, 
Me and my brother are currently looking for a new roommate in our three-bedroom townhouse located on 328 S. Bouquet street. Rent is $450 a month not including utilities—and I’ll let you know now, that if you do not pitch on internet, you will not be given the Wi-Fi password. Me and my brother are adamant on cleanliness and require house booties in any room besides the front foyer. Our last roommate was forced to leave after he began to abuse the food labeling system we provide for maximum efficiency in the kitchen. We do not allow pets, its light out by 11 P.M on weekdays (8 P.M on Saturday because me and my brother attend Chapel every Sunday at 6 A.M,) and all visitors must be signed in just to ensure all missing property can be accounted for. There is also a no drug policy that is strictly enforced. Alcohol is allowed on Holidays accepted under the Catholic calendar. If anyone is interested please contact me through e-mail at aestheticallypleasing@hotmail.com or text my cell phone at (315) 325-8567. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY
