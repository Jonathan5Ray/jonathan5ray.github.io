<h2> My Reflection </h2>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this project much more than the original work in progress. It is the fact that it is less tedious and more project-driven then material-driven, if that makes sense? You gave us the freedom to work past the original parameters of the project and gave us more liberty than previously offered.  Rather than force us to religiously follow the class guidelines, you let us warp the task at hand into something much different. 
  </p>
  <p>For example, my movie poster idea was something I don’t think you might’ve accepted during class. I thought that rather than force one genre into another, I would put two films that have entirely different characters, ambiances, directions and films into one another. Instead of focusing on the poster, I took the actual substance of the films and used that to guide me. I thought that Michael B Jordan is a younger, more promising actor than an aged Danny Glover who was riding off the success of Lethal Weapon, and therefore “Fruitvale Station” would be the base of the project rather than “Predator 2.” I didn’t want to completely remove the nostalgia of the “Predator” poster but I also didn’t want to ruin the controlled chaos of the “Fruitvale Station” cover, so, I had to decide which one was going to hold more of a presence on the cover over one another (“Fruitvale Station” was the victor.) I thought that to blend the two and have the poster be somewhat believable, I needed to go with the “Predator 2” logo instead of the original “Fruitvale Station” logo, as I felt it was more dominant and demanded space. From here, I added in more film festival reviews, as well as review from Ellen DeGeneres herself. The inclusion of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the nuke explosion added to the aesthetic. If you’ve seen Predator 2 you know it has a black main character and the setting is in Los Angeles (Fruitvale Station’s too.) Oscar Grant is killed on the subway platform and that is the background of the film’s cover. The conclusion of Predator has Hagger (Danny Glover’s character) duel with a predator in an underground lair. Rather than nullify this concept entirely, I figured that Fruitvale’s Station’s use of a subway platform could just cross over to Predator 2 final battle. I was going to include an image of a predator as well but there are none online that fit into the image well, or had the correct placement.

  <p>For my storyboard idea, I felt that creating an actual template rather than using one online would just add to my aesthetic. I used the infinite window pattern, accented by a dull red for this soft pink vibe. I don know why, and it often doesn’t translate well, but pink or soft reds are some of my favorite colors. Knowing simple characteristics and associations with color, red is not a color way or scheme that is popular online or widely used. Think about it, besides YouTube—which is still predominantly white—what major websites or graphic design’s use red? I’ll wait. Moving on from the template, I found it quite easy to fill up the story board. I may not be the world’s best painter using a mouse, but Leonardo DaVinci would be proud. For the actual content of the story board I decided to have my documentary centered around the concept of Phantasms. I thought it would be wise to have the documentary open with two friends discussing with one another on how one doesn’t fit the stereotype of “being from Texas.” They go through images of different associations with Texas that are widely outdated, ignorant, and not true. The purpose of my storyboard is to show how Phantasms’ are images integrated with cultural knowledge and beliefs, yet when this knowledge is combined with a sensory or mental image it is automatically believed or perceived as truth. The only time it isn’t perceived as truth is if it is taken out of its native cultural setting. This project had a lot of freedom in the sense you can make it about anything if it is applicable to the topic, but limited through the form of a documentary.

  <p>For my rendition of the old advertisement, I believed that keeping the aesthetic of the older image was crucial to its purpose. Rather than sharpen the image and accent colors to make it looks more new age, I decided to stay with the grainy quality. Instead of fixing the text at the bottom or editing it at all, I figured it’d be easier to just cut it. For the large text that stood at the top, I used the magic wand tool—which I am not a complete idiot with anymore, surprisingly—by adjusting the contrast of the image so specific colors stood apart from one another. Then I’d saturate the image to make the pixels truly stand apart from one another and cut out the lettering that lined the top. After cutting the text from above the young boy’s head, I used a clipping mask to have an image consume the text. In this case, I used a psychedelic photo I have been in love with forever as it is a stark contrast to the original advertisement (Crest toothpaste.) After this, I was stuck on what else to do. Cut his head? Replace his face? Remove the tube of toothpaste he is holding? No, none of them. I decided to change color scheme of photos, by going into the adjustment panel of a layer and adjusting the Hue/Saturation of the image. This panel allows you to alter specific color hues such as magentas, blues, cyans, reds, and purples. In turn, this creates different “filters” by messing with the hue, saturation, and lightness of a specific color. It usually takes a few hours of fiddling around to see what color is accentuated the best by the highlights. For the last project, I felt that green or purple hues proved to be the best, but for this retro ad from forever ago, I think red proved the best. It kind of makes it demonic in a sense, as the little boy looks identical to Danny Torrance from The Shining. I transformed this Crest ad from an innocent young boy to a possibly demonic child tripping his ass off. Maybe LSD is an active ingredient in toothpaste!

  <p>I almost revised some of my earlier writing but figured that it would be pointless as I have already revised them a few times. I could revise some of my earlier reflections but personally, I believe that will distract me from the material I need to present for this project by being consumed with material in a previous project. For the theme of mywebsite,i have kept it very static. I am not one for the flashy and unneccessary but rather the basic and simple. I changed the background color again, this time to red which I believe pops more. Maybe it is too dramatic and takes attention from the actual material posted. Maybe for the final portfolio I will alter the design of my website but the concept that I orignally chose has remained prevelent.
