  <p style="indent"> This is extremely time consuming! There is the time spent watching the videos, which sometimes can take upwards of an hour by time I rewind and rewind to get the minute details, then there is the actual use of the software! This proved difficult at first because my laptop doesn’t have the RAM space to download Adobe Photoshop so if I want to actually work on this project and learn as I go, I have to be on campus in order to do so—I live in Shadyside. With the distance aside, as well as the time, this project is fun to say the least. The fact we get to learn on our own time and not be rushed or forced to keep up with others—which I can say for this class, having very little to zero computer science knowledge doesn’t make it any easier—makes this something I actually want to do. Lynda tutorials will drain the life out of you, as that monotonous, over-friendly voice rips through your ear drums every time she mentions the “pen tool.” 
	I actually really enjoyed the YouTube tutorials I have watched so far, as their approach is user-friendly! Something I appreciate very much. Learning Photoshop is not something I could necessarily do in person, as my frustration with my instructor as well as my incompatibility to pick up the material fast would just result in a brawl. Instead, I would rather much sit by myself and take the approach I am both more receptive too and comfortable with. Having trouble understanding the magic pen. Maybe it just doesn’t work for me?
