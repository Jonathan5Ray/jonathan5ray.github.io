  <p class="indent">Well, where do I start? Photoshop is hands down one of the craziest, most bizarre, and mind-altering software’s that I have ever used. I thought that I knew the power of Photoshop, but the extent the software can go was unbeknownst to me. Learning the actual basics of Photoshop—utilizing tools such as the move tool, the lasso tool, the spot moving tool, and the crop tool—made Photoshop EXTREMELY EASY. Nobody really teaches you how to use the basics and rather than take the time to show you the software from the beginning, everyone rushes into the more difficult tools (something PHLEARN’s—a YouTube channel— host Aaron Nace mentions in “How to Use Layer Masks in Photoshop,” saying that most people often forget to “cover the basics.”)</p>
  <p class="indent"> To understand the basic tools of Photoshop, I found that Lynda online tutorials as well as MisterNinjaBoy’s channel on YouTube proved to be the most useful. A cool trick that I picked from his YouTube channel is that to reverse an image you’ve made into a layer, just negate the values. You do this by pressing CTR+T, letting you adjust the width and height values but rather than alter the dimensions, you negate them. This will flip the image over its axis vertically or horizontally, depending on what value you negate. PHLEARN is also a site I was fond of, as they offer a more laid-back, less formal approach to learning Photoshop. As I learned the basics, my interest shifted from mastering the clone tool and the use of contrast in images—as that is my favorite principle of design—to wanting to understand the entirety of the software. Since my last use in 10th grade technology class, the software and it’s plethora of uses has doubled and my basic knowledge was almost obsolete</p>
  <p class="indent"> Trying to figure out the multiple uses of the clone tool is where my interest began to change. PHLEARN played a large role in this as well as their tutorials range from extremely creative uses of the application such as creating beams of light within the software, to adding fog and light, to enhancing the quality of a photo. This caused me to view Photoshop as a software that offers more than just its face value. This realization made me feel a bit naïve, as my preconceptions—or prior knowledge—led me to believe that Photoshop was a glorified filter on photos. With my original use in High School, the majority of projects were replacing my friend’s heads on to the images of something we found hilarious, whether that was Oprah or Ralphie May. With my newfound knowledge, I realize that Photoshop is whatever you want it to be, literally. </p>
  <p class="indent"> Outside resources I happened to use were the actual help tab within Photoshop. It links you to the Adobe site and from there, Adobe offers their own tutorials and assistants that can give you real-time support. I often found that most of Adobe’s tutorials weren’t in layman’s terms and unless you knew the software you would somewhat be lost. My roommate is a Computer Science major and helped me somewhat on getting a hang of the smudge tool. I like the aesthetic it added to photos, but I couldn’t find a middle ground of what was enough and what was too much. With his help, I found that I just had to adjust the hardness of the tool and that will affect the degree to which the image is smudged. Adjusting which actual brush you use served to be useful as well once I got down to trying to work with pixels. My biggest difficulty I was unable to overcome over the course of this project was the use of the magic pen tool. It is literally impossible to use if you’re image possess pixels that are roughly the same color. Well, for most of my images I wanted to work with, I would have to go in and adjust the contrast of the image in order to more starkly pronounce the individual colors. But who wants to that every time you want to cut something from an image? I just learned to stay away from the magic wand tool, even after almost an hour of tutorials. Instead, I just started to use the lasso tool. Now it may not be as precise as the magic wand tool, but I would rather just use that tool then add a layer mask and work from that!</p>
  <p class="indent"> I often found myself in the library’s computer lab. Working on this project. It not only offers the software but it is also a quiet space to work in. The aid of computer lab technicians is also a positive. Learning Photoshop is not something that I can do in five minutes spurts in between classes or when I have a little break, it is not that simple. I like to sit down and binge, which isn’t a healthy study habit I admit, but I like to obsess over things. So when I actually sit down to watch tutorial videos or mess around with the interface, I try and give myself at least two hour blocks. It gives me the space to repeat the same 10-second fragment over and over again without rushing to just be done with it. It gives me the time to get the hang of the tiny things, and that is what truly matters in Photoshop. Headphones in, you could find me in Hillman trying to bust this out. I will say there is one thing that annoys the living hell out of me. Why wont my images upload with good quality? As for the ones I uploaded to my site they do not appear the same in Photoshop, with the one's within the software possessing much better quality.</p>
<p class="indent"> Overall, I appreciated this project. It isn’t often a professor gives you a project to learn on your own time and on your schedule. Photoshop is a wonderful software that I wish people gave a priority too, as I believe the direction the world is heading today is going to require graphic design in almost every facet of life besides manual laborers.  </MAIN>
