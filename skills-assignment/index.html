  <H2> Preliminary Curriculum </H2>
  <p>	My overall aim is to actually learn photoshop through trial and error, practice, and repetition. Building into deeper concepts, I wish to be able to fully incorporate elements of photoshop like contrast, filters, and cloning images. Personally, I believe they are the most intriguing tools in Photoshop, and something that for my personal taste would approve of. I also think mastering composite images—blending multiple photos into one—is something very “cool” that you can do with Photoshop.</p>
