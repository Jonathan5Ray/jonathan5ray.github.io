  <H2> Preliminary Curriculum </H2>
  <p>	My overall aim is to actually learn photoshop through trial and error, practice, and repetition. Building into deeper concepts, I wish to be able to fully incorporate elements of photoshop like contrast, filters, and cloning images. Personally, I believe they are the most intriguing tools in Photoshop, and something that for my personal taste would approve of. I also think mastering composite images—blending multiple photos into one—is something very “cool” that you can do with Photoshop.</p>

  <tr><td>2/24/18</td><td>2/24/18</td><td>"How to Use the Refine Edge Tool"</td><td> Fifteen minutes</td><td>This calls for the use of the magic pen so you can precisley crop the image. I really suck with using the magic pen and this doesnt help me later when i try and reenact the tutorial. An extremeyl cool concept!</td></tr>
