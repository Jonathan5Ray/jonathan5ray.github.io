  <p style="indent"> Things are starting to heat up now! Having a grasp on the basics (well at least I think I do,) my next focus is to dive into the deeper concepts. Now for some of these, they skip the intermediate phase and jump to the hardest difficulty, such as creating reflections of images or objects without flat edges—such as a soda can. I probably won’t get much done with these are they’re time consuming projects and often deal with variables I still haven’t learned or gotten the hang of yet (like the magic pen.) At this point I think I should start to deal with the use of contrast in images and how it affects the mood or motion a picture evokes. </p>
  <p style="indent">I learned how to place an image within the text but I am having difficulty softening the edges of images so I can place multiple images within the text without seeing the individual images background or outlines. It is somewhat difficult but that’s in part to the fact that the images I am working with weren’t taken with Photoshop in mind, therefore not lending a helping hand to whatever edits I decide to make on an image. For example, the first time I went to go and actually use the mask layer following PHLEARN’s video, I could not get the magic pen tool to outline the image of my dog to save my life. It just kept either highlighting the whole image or it’d be sporadically placed all around. I tried altering the contrast of the photo and it helped somewhat, but not to the extent I wanted it too. In total, I have excluded the magic pen from my curriculum.  </p>
  <p stlke="indent"> There is also a lot of cool tricks and tips you just randomly figure out by fiddling with the software, such as the character window which helps you completely alter text in any fashion you’d like. From stretching it, to widening it, to making the font size 628, the possibilities and combinations are endless.  </p>
