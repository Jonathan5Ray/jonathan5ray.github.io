  <h3> Biography </h3>
  <p> Jonathan Ray is a 19-year-old Sophomore, currently enrolled at The University of Pittsburgh. He is majoring in English Writing on the non-fiction track. His hopes after college are varied, but his main interests are in screenwriting and television. His dream job would consist of working as a freelance reporter for VICE.
  </P> <p>Jonathan was born and raised in Geneva, New York, located at the tip of Seneca Lake in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. He holds a 3.2 GPA and is an avid reader, loving to be updated on current events. His favorite publications are the New York Times, Politico, and his local newspaper, the Finger Lakes Times. His free time is consumed with making music, writing poetry, and developing his cooking skills, a hidden passion. His favorite football team is the Baltimore Ravens, but he doesn’t shy away from showing love to the local favorite, the Buffalo Bills. Mr. Ray is also a local music enthusiast, often finding himself at popular venues like the Rabbit Hole and the Bushnell. His passion for Hip-Hop music is reflected in his speech and character, wishing he grew up in the 90’s rather than being born in them. His favorite artists are the Notorious B.I.G, Big L, Nas, Childish Gambino, Big K.R.I.T, and Capital STEEZ. Mr.Ray’s work-ethic has proved to be battle-tested and is a driving force in his success.

  <h3> Craigslist Ad </h3>
  <p> Hello, </p>
  <p> Me and my brother are currently looking for a new roommate in our three-bedroom apartment located at 42 Westmore Avenue in Squirrel Hill. Rent is $450 a month and that is excluding utilities—I’ll let you know now, if you do not pitch on internet, you will not be given the Wi-Fi password. Me and my brother are adamant on cleanliness and require house booties in any room besides the front foyer. We eat dinner every night at 6:28 p.m. on the dot, except for Thursday’s—we go to Dave & Busters. Our last roommate was forced to leave after he began to abuse the food labeling system we provide for maximum efficiency in the kitchen. If this seems like something you’re not capable of understanding, then I’d advise you stop reading now. Lights are out by 11 p.m. on weekdays (8 p.m. on Saturday because me and my brother attend Chapel every Sunday at 6 a.m.,) and all visitors must be signed in to ensure all missing property can be accounted for. There is also a no drug policy that is strictly enforced. Alcohol is allowed on Holidays accepted under the Catholic calendar. If anyone is interested, please contact me through e-mail at aestheticallypleasing@hotmail.com or text my cell phone at (315) 325-8567. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY</p>
  <p> P.S. We are swingers and take place in a neighborhood orgy every third Tuesday. We’d ask if you give us our respect and privacy</p>
