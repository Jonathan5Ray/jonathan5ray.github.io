  <h2> My Final Reflection </h2>
<h2> Website Design </h2>
  <p> My website design, motivated by Krakos’ Lo-Fi Manifesto, was a very basic, static design. The focus wasn’t so much on the genre (although that did play a part) but more importantly on the audience. Knowing that a large percentage of people aren’t tech-savvy or experts of the internet, the simple, yet engaging website design I chose encapsulates my intention. It lacks the bright lights and condensed, almost over-whelming feeling that most modern websites suffer from, but it also doesn’t have the black-and-white retro feel of the early 2000’s. The goal for creating this website was to design a site that did not call for assistance or help. It is easy to maneuver through and space is taken into great consideration, seen by the lack of any photos stacked side-by-side as well as the margins of the site. </p>

  <h3> Craigslist Ad </h3>
  <p> Hello, </p>
  <p> Me and my brother are currently looking for a new roommate in our three-bedroom apartment located at 42 Westmore Avenue in Squirrel Hill. Rent is $450 a month and that is excluding utilities—I’ll let you know now, if you do not pitch on internet, you will not be given the Wi-Fi password. Me and my brother are adamant on cleanliness and require house booties in any room besides the front foyer. We eat dinner every night at 6:28 p.m. on the dot, except for Thursday’s—we go to Dave & Busters. Our last roommate was forced to leave after he began to abuse the food labeling system we provide for maximum efficiency in the kitchen. If this seems like something you’re not capable of understanding, then I’d advise you stop reading now. Lights are out by 11 p.m. on weekdays (8 p.m. on Saturday because me and my brother attend Chapel every Sunday at 6 a.m.,) and all visitors must be signed in to ensure all missing property can be accounted for. There is also a no drug policy that is strictly enforced. Alcohol is allowed on Holidays accepted under the Catholic calendar. If anyone is interested, please contact me through e-mail at aestheticallypleasing@hotmail.com or text my cell phone at (315) 325-8567. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY</p>
  <p> P.S. We are swingers and take place in a neighborhood orgy every third Tuesday. We’d ask if you give us our respect and privacy</p>
  <h3> Week Four Writing </h3>
  <p> My concept of a “good website” is something that consists of three things: accessibility, difficulty/ease to navigate, and openness. Rather than develop a website that takes rocket scientists to use, I believe strongly that websites should be static in design for the purpose of accessibility. Rather than design websites for the purpose of being aesthetically pleasing, create websites with the understanding that a majority of users aren’t tech savvy. If you only knew how many times I have had to help both my mother and father with recovering e-mail passwords, tax information, and other personal information online you’d get light-headed. It isn’t that my parents aren’t coherent, it is the fact these websites aren’t designed with the lowest level users taken into mind. If my mother who is 51 must call me to ask how to delete a photo off of her Facebook, then the site isn’t designed to be user-friendly. If the actual users cannot navigate the site, what purpose does it serve? </p>
  <p>  I prefer a basic website that leans towards simplicity and delivering material rathe than the aesthetic and lights. I am a person who appreciates technology but to over complicate it all the time is sometimes unnecessary. For the spatial design, I love great spacing. Dense, over-crowded material gives me a headache and causes me to feel overwhelmed the material being pushed at me. In terms of the color scheme, I am more appreciative of basic colors rather than photos and color gradients. Sites that stay loyal to black and white color schemes such as the New York Times are my favorite as they learn to make even the basic extraordinary. </p>
  <p> With my website, my design is something I hope is clean and easy-to-use. I want to tighten the text along the heading and have the website be quirky and weird.. I’d rather not have a complex aesthetic, as it is not what I appreciate in a website and I don’t wish to reflect something I don’t even appreciate. I think the “wow” of my website will be from the images I decide to upload and post that are of me. I may struggle with getting them in, as it has proven to be a pain in the ass but hopefully the website is exactly what I want it to be.  </p>
