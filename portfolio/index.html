  <h2> My Final Reflection </h2>
<h2> Website Design </h2>
  <p> My website design, motivated by Krakos’ Lo-Fi Manifesto, was a very basic, static design. The focus wasn’t so much on the genre (although that did play a part) but more importantly on the audience. Knowing that a large percentage of people aren’t tech-savvy or experts of the internet, the simple, yet engaging website design I chose encapsulates my intention. It lacks the bright lights and condensed, almost over-whelming feeling that most modern websites suffer from, but it also doesn’t have the black-and-white retro feel of the early 2000’s. The goal for creating this website was to design a site that did not call for assistance or help. It is easy to maneuver through and space is taken into great consideration, seen by the lack of any photos stacked side-by-side as well as the margins of the site. </p>

  <h2> Redesigning an old advertisment </h2>
  <p> The audience and intentions for advertising versus website design are entirely different, yet the choices in terms of the aesthetic remain the same. For Photoshop, the variables which one can adjust are seemingly endless. Rather than have a set plan and idea, the end result is usually crowned after hours of fiddling around with the software. For the classwork assignment of recreating an older advertisement, I decided that the Crest Toothpaste ad was the one with the most freedom to work with. In the first three renditions I had of the ad, the color scales were shifted in different directions. At that point I was stuck between maximizing the greens, lowering the presence of magentas, or cooling the blues. In the end, I decided to saturate the magentas rather than minimize them. This created an “Omen”-like effect on the little boy in the ad. Rather than Jimmy from Slauson Lane we have Damien from “The Omen.” In this specific photo, I was also stuck between creating a clipping mask and putting an image behind the text of the image or delete them entirely. Fooling around with both methods, it proved that using a clipping mask pronounced the letters and was abstract enough from the rest of the advertisement that it almost stood by itself. </p>

  <h2> Movie Genre's </h2>
 <p> For the in-class movie poster assignment, it was all determined on choice. You could be very shallow and just blend two films whose theatrical posters are similar or you could actually sit down, and find movies in opposing genres that parallel one another on multiple planes. For me, this was finding an action film that coincided with a drama. First, I used the setting. “Predators 2” takes place in Los Angeles, California while “Fruitvale Station” takes place largely in Oakland, California. Following that similarity, both protagonists are African-American—Micheal B Jordan and Danny Glover. Finally, the two films are centered around man versus environment conflict. Glover struggles locating and capturing an animal or beast that seemingly blends into its environment, while Jordan is in a constant struggle against his neighborhood. Finally, I paid close attention to whether or not the genre would be able to blend with the opposing genre. Luckily drama and action thriller seem to go hand in hand despite their stark differences in plot, characters, and their individual motivations.  </p>

  <h2> THE MAGIC WAND TOOL </h2>
  <p> I can promise you that the magic wand tool doesn’t work. I easily spent over four hours trying to learn this piece of junk but to no avail.  The pen tool works perfectly but the magic wand tool just doesn’t work. I tried changing the saturation of images, so the pixel density would be increased, and the magic wand tool would be more precise with its outlines but yet again, to no avail. I watched PHLEARN videos by the boat load and asked Photoshop experts how it works and how to master it but even they told me to give up and just use the pen tool. I can never get those four hours back. Such a waste of time. Nothing is worse than when I would watch a more complex tutorial and they’d specifically use the magic wand tool and praise of its abilities while im stuck on the first step trying to get the damn widget to work! </p>

  <h2> My development in the class as a whole!</h2>
  <p> I touched on this a lot during my Work-in-Progress presentation, but the thing I am most proud of over the course of this semester is my individual progress. I struggled with things that consisted both in and out of the realm of college but still managed to develop the basic skills it needs to navigate in the field of digital media. I would say that Photoshop is the software I am the proudest of learning, but at the same time, the lengths I have made in both HTML and CSS would lead to a debate over whether that’s true or not. The design concepts we learned in class were and are very influential in my progress from here. Just understanding and applying basic principles like spacing, contrast, priming, and many more has given me much confidence in moving forward. Now whether that is as a computer assistant in the library or as a professional speaker depends on where the wind takes me! Me, now compared to the first day of class are two entirely different people. Maturity wise, intelligence wise, and computer skills wise. </p>

  <h3> Craigslist Ad </h3>
  <p> Hello, </p>
  <p> Me and my brother are currently looking for a new roommate in our three-bedroom apartment located at 42 Westmore Avenue in Squirrel Hill. Rent is $450 a month and that is excluding utilities—I’ll let you know now, if you do not pitch on internet, you will not be given the Wi-Fi password. Me and my brother are adamant on cleanliness and require house booties in any room besides the front foyer. We eat dinner every night at 6:28 p.m. on the dot, except for Thursday’s—we go to Dave & Busters. Our last roommate was forced to leave after he began to abuse the food labeling system we provide for maximum efficiency in the kitchen. If this seems like something you’re not capable of understanding, then I’d advise you stop reading now. Lights are out by 11 p.m. on weekdays (8 p.m. on Saturday because me and my brother attend Chapel every Sunday at 6 a.m.,) and all visitors must be signed in to ensure all missing property can be accounted for. There is also a no drug policy that is strictly enforced. Alcohol is allowed on Holidays accepted under the Catholic calendar. If anyone is interested, please contact me through e-mail at aestheticallypleasing@hotmail.com or text my cell phone at (315) 325-8567. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY</p>
  <p> P.S. We are swingers and take place in a neighborhood orgy every third Tuesday. We’d ask if you give us our respect and privacy</p>
  <h3> Week Four Writing </h3>
  <p> My concept of a “good website” is something that consists of three things: accessibility, difficulty/ease to navigate, and openness. Rather than develop a website that takes rocket scientists to use, I believe strongly that websites should be static in design for the purpose of accessibility. Rather than design websites for the purpose of being aesthetically pleasing, create websites with the understanding that a majority of users aren’t tech savvy. If you only knew how many times I have had to help both my mother and father with recovering e-mail passwords, tax information, and other personal information online you’d get light-headed. It isn’t that my parents aren’t coherent, it is the fact these websites aren’t designed with the lowest level users taken into mind. If my mother who is 51 must call me to ask how to delete a photo off of her Facebook, then the site isn’t designed to be user-friendly. If the actual users cannot navigate the site, what purpose does it serve? </p>
  <p>  I prefer a basic website that leans towards simplicity and delivering material rathe than the aesthetic and lights. I am a person who appreciates technology but to over complicate it all the time is sometimes unnecessary. For the spatial design, I love great spacing. Dense, over-crowded material gives me a headache and causes me to feel overwhelmed the material being pushed at me. In terms of the color scheme, I am more appreciative of basic colors rather than photos and color gradients. Sites that stay loyal to black and white color schemes such as the New York Times are my favorite as they learn to make even the basic extraordinary. </p>
  <p> With my website, my design is something I hope is clean and easy-to-use. I want to tighten the text along the heading and have the website be quirky and weird.. I’d rather not have a complex aesthetic, as it is not what I appreciate in a website and I don’t wish to reflect something I don’t even appreciate. I think the “wow” of my website will be from the images I decide to upload and post that are of me. I may struggle with getting them in, as it has proven to be a pain in the ass but hopefully the website is exactly what I want it to be.  </p>
