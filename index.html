<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
<p> Jonathan Ray is a 19-year-old sophomore, currently enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, where he is majoring in English Writing on the non-fiction track. He was born and raised in Geneva, New York, which is located at the tip of Seneca Lake in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. Mr. Ray is a lifelong Baltimore Ravens fan, but doesnâ€™t shy from showing love to the hometown favorite, the Buffalo Bills. He likes long walks in the snow, and loves a nice, hearty bowl of chili. Jonathan is also an avid hip-hop fan, often showing his face at a variety of local venues such as the Bushnell on Centre Avenue. He has reconstructed his life to be just like Tony Soprano.</p>
